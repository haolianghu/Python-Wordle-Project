# Wordle-Python
Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. <br>

Wordle.py implement a version of Wordle. The answer will be a 5-letter word that is selected randomly from a wordlist. Just as in the official game, the user will have 6 attempts to guess the answer and will be provided feedback on each guess. Letters in the guess will be marked (below) as follows: <br>
Symbol x means that the letter does not appear in the answer <br>
Symbol ^ means that the letter is correct and in the correct location <br>
Symbol + means that the letter is correct, but in the wrong location <br>

As a player makes guesses in Wordle, they gain information about what letters are and are not in the solution and where some of those letters fall in the answer. WordleAssistant.py is a tool that can help find potential solutions by using the information gained while playing Wordle. <br>

Wordlist.txt is an example word list file that can be used for the game.
